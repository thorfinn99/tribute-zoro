                <h1>The Minority Hunter</h1>
                <p>Zoro has a stern, serious, and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining a lookout in the ship's crow's nest (which on the Thousand Sunny ship also doubles as his personal gym). He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and the first to react. He is often displayed as being well aware of dangerous situations and the people around him.
                    Zoro often reminds others of the harsh facts, which shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. It can be seen when Luffy and Usopp had a fight and Usopp left the crew, Zoro said that Luffy is the captain of the ship and everyone must respect him without any exception and so Usopp must apologize to Luffy before he joins the crew. And he also added that if Luffy takes in Usopp without his apology to Luffy then next one leaving the crew will be Zoro himself. Later everyone understood him and decided that Zoro is right about it. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has much-untapped potential and is constantly seen training and improving his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.</p>
